It offers much faster internet speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect more devices at the same time compared to previous generations like 3G and 4G.
                5G is not just about faster smartphonesâ€”it will change how we live, work, and interact with technology. From self-driving cars to smart cities, 5G is expected to power the future and open the door to many new possibilities.</p>
